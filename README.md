Framebuffer Draw is a lightweight C++ library designed for direct pixel manipulation and drawing of 2D primitives on Linux systems using the framebuffer (/dev/fb0). It allows developers to render shapes such as lines, rectangles, circles, and pixels without relying on external graphics libraries or display servers. Ideal for low-level graphics, embedded systems, or custom Linux environments where minimal dependencies are essential.

Key features:
- Direct framebuffer access (/dev/fb0)
- Support for basic drawing primitives (pixels, lines, rectangles, circles, etc.)
- Minimal dependencies (no SDL, OpenGL, or X11 required)
- Easy-to-use C++ API for low-level graphics programming
