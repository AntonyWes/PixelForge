PixelForge is a lightweight C++ library designed for direct pixel manipulation and drawing of 2D primitives on Linux systems using the framebuffer (/dev/fb0).
It allows developers to render shapes such as lines, rectangles, circles, and pixels without relying on external graphics libraries or display servers.
